                    <h2>What is Rozgar?</h2>
                        <h2>Qard-ul-Hasana</h2>
                        <p>
                        Rozgar is a not-for-profit organization that provides interest-free microcredit based on Islamic principles and law.
    <br>                    It is an initiative to provide financial assistance to promote self-reliance in capable but economically challenged individuals.
    <br>                    Based on the Islamic concept of Qard-ul-Hasana&#59; Rozgar provides a beneficial loan&#44; which is returned at the end of an agreed period, without any interest, repaid in full as the original amount of the loan.

                                                    <b> Qard-ul-Hasana in Light of the Quran & Sunnah</b>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                             In many places of the Holy Quran, Almighty Allah has mentioned and encouraged Qard-ul-Hasana (a goodly loan) by assuring a better reward in this world and the Hereafter.<br>

                            <br>&quot Who is he that will lend to Allah a goodly loan so that He may multiply it for him many times?&quot [Al-Baqarah (2): 245]<br>
<br>&quot If you lend Allah a goodly loan, He will double it for you, and will forgive you. And Allah is Most Ready to appreciate and to reward, Most Forbearing.&quot        [Al-Tagabun (64):17]<br>
<br>&quot And give Allah a goodly loan.&quot [ Al-Maidah (5): 12]<br>
<br>&quot Those men and women who give Sadaqat and lend Allah a goodly loan, it shall be increased manifold and theirs shall be an honorable good reward.&quot               [ Al-Hadid (57): 18]<br>
<br>&quot ...recite as much of the   as may be easy for you, and perform As-Salat and give Zakat, and lend to Allah a goodly loan. And whatever good you send before you for yourselves, you will certainly find it with Allah, better and greater in reward. &quot [Al-Muzzammil (73): 20]<br>
<br>Hadith and Sunnah of the Prophet also emphasize Qard-ul-Hasana.<br>
<br>In a hadith reported by Abu Hurairah, the Prophet (S.A.S) said,<br>                 &#34;Whoever relieves a believer from a difficulty in this world, Allah will relieve him from his difficulty and Allah will facilitate him in this world and the Hereafter.&#34;
